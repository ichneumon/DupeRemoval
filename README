Duplicate Removal

Setup the Script
a simple chmod 700 duplicates.sh (770) should do the trick

Remove Duplicates
Right now you have to place the script in the top level of the directory tree where you want to remove the duplicates. This should be changed to a target of the top level later. (simple cd to the target. After script completion a cd - should work)

This was created to fix hyrcan's massive amounts of duplicate mp3s but it should be applicable to any file type.
